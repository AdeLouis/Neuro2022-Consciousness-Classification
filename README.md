# Consciousness Classification Using Physiological Signals

A patient’s level of consciousness is crucial for determining their care and prognosis. However, no methods continuously monitor consciousness and alert clinicians to changes. To overcome this challenge and help clinicians better monitor patient health in critically ill patients, we develop a framework for classifying a patient’s state of consciousness using only physiological signals routinely collected in the ICU from patients with subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhages.
